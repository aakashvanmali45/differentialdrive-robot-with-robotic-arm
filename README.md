## üìö Key Learning Outcomes

During the course and this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

1. **Transform Frames (TF):** Understanding and visualizing coordinate frames using `tf2` in RViz.
2. **URDF Modeling:** Building both a differential drive robot and a robotic arm using Unified Robot Description Format (URDF).
3. **Inertial and Collision Tags:** Enhancing robot realism and safety within simulations.
4. **ROS 2 Launch Files:** Automating node and simulation startup with custom launch files.
5. **Xacro Macros:** Optimizing and modularizing URDF files using Xacro.
6. **Function Definitions in Xacro:** Creating parameterized robot models for scalability.
7. **Gazebo Integration:** Simulating the complete robot system and verifying its motion and structure in a realistic environment.
